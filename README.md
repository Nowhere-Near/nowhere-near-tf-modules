This repository serves as a centralized collection of reusable Terraform modules designed for Nowhere Near projects. It provides standardized, production-ready infrastructure components that can be leveraged across both internal and external projects, ensuring consistency, scalability, and best practices in infrastructure as code. Each module is versioned and documented to facilitate easy integration and maintenance, supporting a wide range of cloud and on-premises environments as required by Nowhere Near's evolving needs.
